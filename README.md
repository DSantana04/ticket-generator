# ðŸŽ« Ticket Generator

This activity is about a frontend challenge that recquires to construct a website that generates a ticket to a Coding Conference. The website was built without any kind of library or framework, just the pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The most difficult challenge from this work was the CSS and HTML strcture and the JavaScript logic, and it took a long time to adjust the CSS to what was requested.
